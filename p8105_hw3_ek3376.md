The ny_noaa dataset has 2.595175^{6} observations and 7 variables. Key
variables that are included in this dataset are id, date, prcp, snow,
snwd, tmax, tmin. These variables are identified as followed:

id: Weather station ID, date: Date of observation, prcp: Precipitation
(tenths of mm), snow: Snowfall (mm), snwd: Snow depth (mm). tmax:
Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C), and tmin: Minimum temperature
(tenths of degrees C).

The ny_noaa dataset has 3387623 missing values.

### data cleaning

``` r
ny_noaa = ny_noaa |>
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) |>
  mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date), day = day(date)) |>
  mutate(prcp = as.numeric(prcp) / 10, tmax = as.numeric(tmax) / 10, tmin = as.numeric(tmin) / 10, snwd = as.numeric(snwd) / 10)
```

### snowfall observations

``` r
ny_noaa |>
  count(snow) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice_head(n=5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 2
    ##    snow       n
    ##   <int>   <int>
    ## 1     0 2008508
    ## 2    NA  381221
    ## 3    25   31022
    ## 4    13   23095
    ## 5    51   18274

The most common observation of snowfall is 0 mm, since many regions may
lack snow during most times of the year. The second most common
observation was NA, which is expected due to the high proportion of
missing data.

### plot

``` r
ny_noaa |>
  filter(month %in% c(1,7)) |>
  group_by(id, month, year) |>
  summarise(avg_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
              ggplot(aes(x = id, y=avg_tmax, color = month)) + geom_point() + geom_path() + facet_grid(~month) + labs(title = "Average Max Temperature in January and July")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'month'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: Removed 5970 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

    ## Warning: Removed 5640 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_path()`).

Based on the plots, July appears to have a greater averager max
temperature than July.

## Problem 2

``` r

  janitor::clean_names()
```

  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, 1 ~ "male", 2 ~ "female"), sex = factor(sex), 
         education = case_match(education, 1 ~ "Less than high school", 2 ~ "High school equivalent", 3 ~ "More than high school"), education = factor(education))
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5

``` r
#combine datasets
mims_nhanes = full_join(covar_nhanes, accel_nhanes, by = "seqn") |>
  filter(!is.na(sex), !is.na(age), !is.na(education), age >= 21) 
```

The dataset above includes a combination of the accel and covar datasets
while filtering out missing demographic data and individuals less than
21 years of age.

### education category by sex table

``` r
mims_nhanes |>
  group_by(education, sex) |>
  janitor::tabyl(sex, education)
```

    ##     sex High school equivalent Less than high school More than high school
    ##  female                     23                    29                    59
    ##    male                     36                    28                    56

The table above shows the number of male and female participants in each
eduaction category. Based on the table, there appear to be more males
with a high school equivalent education, while the other education
levels appear to be relatively equal in sex distribution, with more
slightly females having more than high school education and less than
high school education.

``` r
mims_nhanes |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + facet_grid(~ education) + labs(title = "Age distribution by Sex and Education Categories", x = "Age", y = "Density")
```

![](p8105_hw3_ek3376_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- --> The
density plot above displays the age distributions for men and women in
each education category. Based on the plot, females with a high school
equivalent education tend to be older than males. For those with less
than high school education, sex distribution is relatively similar with
slightly more females being older in age. Finally, for more than high
school education, there is a high density of young females.

### total activity plot

``` r
mims_nhanes |>
  mutate(mims_total = rowSums(across(min1:min1440), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = mims_total, color = sex)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + facet_grid(. ~ education) + labs(title = "Total Activity by Age and Education Level", x = "Age", y = "Total MIMS")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_ek3376_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- --> The
plot above displays a three-panel scatter plot comparing total activity
by sex and age for each education category. Based on the plots, females
with a high school equivalent degree appear to have a higher total MIMS
overall in comparison to males. Among those with less than a high school
degree, younger females appear to have a greater total MIMS than younger
males while older males appear to have a greater total MIMS than older
females. Among those with more than a high school degree, females have a
greater total MIMS overall in comparison to males.

### acccelerometer plot

``` r
mims_nhanes_long = mims_nhanes |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("min"),
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "MIMS"
  )

mims_nhanes_avg = mims_nhanes_long |>
  group_by(minute, education, sex) |>
  summarize(avg_mims = mean(MIMS, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'minute', 'education'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
mims_nhanes_avg |>
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = avg_mims, color = sex, group =sex)) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + facet_grid(~ education) + labs(title = "24 Hour Activity Time courses by Education level and Sex", x = "Minute of the Day", y = "average MIMS")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_ek3376_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- --> The
three-panel plot above shows the 24-hour activity time courses by sex
and education level. Based on the plot, those with less than a high
school degree experience a greater average MIMS peak than the other
education groups with comparable MIMS between sex. On the other hand,
among those with high school equivalent and more than high school
education level, females tend to experience a greater peak in average
MIMS than males.

The new citi_data dataset has 6.4748^{4} observations and 9 variables.
This dataset contains information on rides taken on the NYC Citi Bike
system during January 2020, July 2020, Janurary 2024, and July 2024.

### Citi Table

``` r

  group_by(year, month, member_casual) |>
  summarise(ride_total = n())

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'month'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ride_summary_wide = ride_summary |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = member_casual, values_from = ride_total) |>
  arrange(year, month)

print(ride_summary_wide)
```

    ## 3 2024  Jan     2108  16753
    ## 4 2024  July     984  11436

The table above shows the total number of rides in each combination of
year and month by rider type (casual and members). Based on the table,
there were more rides from members than casual riders during all months
and years with a peak in rides during July 2020 and Jan 2024.

    ## 5 Christopher St & Greenwich St         110

Based on the table above, the top 5 most popular stations in July 2020
were 12 Ave & W 40 St, W 21 St & 6 Ave, 1 Ave & E 68 St, West St &
Chambers St, Christopher St & Greenwich St.

### Plot showing effect of day of week, month, and year on median ride duration

``` r

  summarise(median_duration = median(duration, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'weekdays', 'month'. You can override using
    ## the `.groups` argument.

``` r

```

![](p8105_hw3_ek3376_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

The plot above shows the median ride duration by day, month, and year.
Based on the plot, 2020 appears to have a higher median ride duration
than 2024. Additionally, median ride duration is higher in July than
June across all years. Finally, median ride duration peaks on the
weekends for both years in July.

The plot above shows the distribution of ride duration by month and
membership. Based on the plots, members have a lower ride duration than
casual rides. Among casual riders, during the month of January, classic
bikes had a slightly higher ride duration while in July, electric bikes
appeared to have a greater ride duration.
